title: New York City Turnstile Data
---
# Overview
Due to the vagueness of the prompt, we opted for a general strategy. Using Python and the Pandas module on MTA Turnstile data from the 1 month segments from March 2017 to April 2017 and March 2018 to April 2018, we found that 34th Street Station and Herald Square was the optimal station to place a flyering street team from 4pm - 8pm for maximum volume of subway riders. By looking at an index of popular colleges in NYC to the average subway riders exiting the closest station to said colleges, we identified that the West 4th St. Station from 7am to 11 am on weekdays would be the best place to recruit female university students. We also identified 77 St. Station as the best location to place a team for fundraising due to its location in the Upper East Side.

## Group Context
This was the very first group project, in teams of 3, with a timeframe of 4 nights to complete. Experience in python and pandas in our group was next to none because the project was assigned on Day 1 of the Metis bootcamp. I had the pleasure of completing this project with two wonderful individuals Robin Leo Knauth and Matt Carney.

## Prompt
The prompt of this project was the following: 

> As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts.

>WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.
