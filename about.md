My name is Jeremy Chow. I am a:
* Aspiring data scientist
* Lifelong tryharding gamer
* Casual pianist, guitarist, and singer

This blog is for people curious about data science bootcamps and what the project experiences are like. I hope everyone who stops by gains insight into what is currently an underdeveloped and opaque route for post-college learning!
