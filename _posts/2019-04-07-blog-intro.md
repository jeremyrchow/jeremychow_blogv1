title: Introduction

My name is **Jeremy Chow** and this is my first ever blog post! I'm new to Jekyll, blogging, and even github, so bear with me as I figure out how to format and best organize things!

# What's this blog for?
I am starting this blog to document my projects at the 12 week Metis Datascience Bootcamp training program. The data science bootcamp space is relatively new, so I hope this blog will provide people with insight on the bootcamp experience and the outcomes that it may provide. After the bootcamp, I may continue posting about my career as time allows. But first, let me introduce myself!

# Who am I?

That's a challenging question, so I'll start with my educational history: 

* I was born in 1995
* I studied mechanical engineering in community college for two years, then
* Transferred to UC Berkeley and graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2017
* Worked as an Electrical and Controls Engineer in the Corrugated Industry (production of cardboard boxes) from 2018 to 2019

I then quit my job and am currently studying data science for 12 weeks.

## Why would you want to do data science?
My first full time job consisted of a lot of Autocad and bills of materials on top of an already boring industry. I had always been the type to listen to my parents and do what I was told, but over the past year I grew more and more resentful of my situation. For the first time in my life, I decided to take control of my career trajectory. I googled the job with the <a href = "https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm">  highest satisfaction rate </a>, and it happened to match with my slight interest in programming. There are also data scientist positions in the gaming industry, which I am targeting due to my dedication to competitive games my entire life, even in college when <a href = "https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/02/23/uc-berkeley-video-game-team-takes-overwatch-title/"> I won the first collegiate Overwatch tournament </a> with 5 other fantastic gentlemen. See mom? Playing video games for hours each day isn't entirely useless!

## Conclusion
If you have further questions about my background, feel free to contact me. Otherwise, let's continue onto the first project at Metis! I'll post a link do another post discussing the first project here <a href="#"> here </a> when it's complete.
